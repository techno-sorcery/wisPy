<h1>Markdown Test File</h1>

<p><strong>See the raw source of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mxstbr/markdown-test-file/master/TEST.md">TEST.md</a> for the deets!</strong> (<a href="./TEST.md">this is the test file rendered</a>)</p>

<p>This repo contains a markdown file which covers a lot of the syntax. We use it for testing our markdown support.</p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p>The file is based on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.text">the source of John Gruber's Markdown Syntax page</a> (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">this is the page rendered</a>) with all the HTML and some more complex stuff removed. (if you want to support the full entirety of Markdown we'd recommend just using the full page instead of this shortened version)</p>

<p>Full credits for that idea go to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2238012/need-a-sufficiently-long-complex-markdown-document-for-performance-testing">this StackOverflow question</a>.</p>
